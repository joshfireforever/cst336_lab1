                 <h2>Well hello there.</h2>
                 <p> Thanks for visiting my professional portfolio website.</p>
                 <p> Whether I'm working for Apple, designing a base in 7 Days to Die with my 
                 brothers, or reformatting my parents' entire garage, I'm all about efficiency. 
                 I love revising or creating systems to increase automation and reduce overhead 
                 and maintenance. That's why I love programming.</p>
                 <p>I'm in school at CSU Monterey Bay to gain software engineering skills 
                 towards playing a useful role in a nonprofit like Voice of the Martyrs or 
                 Open Doors. I would love to be a part of getting the Bible into as many 
                 peoples' hands as possible, or creating radio or web broadcasts that sends 
                 the gospel message into the homes of those in restricted areas around the work.
                 I'll be hunting for opportunities locally and abroad to combine my love of 
                 efficiency and my love of that message.</p>
                 <p> Feed free to contact me!</p>
